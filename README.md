# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

Built computer algorithms that can identify handwritten digits using MNIST data. Implemented using Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, achieved over 98% accuracy on the Kaggle test set.

**Modeled in Matlab and R**

*Note: The code is a first principles, hardcoded implementation I wrote in Matlab and a caret/kernlab implementation I wrote in R.*
